# Role

When to Offer Content Expertise :

You may have important content to offer that no one else
in the group has. When that happens, tell the team you are
leaving the retrospective leader role temporarily to contribute
to the discussion. Hand your marker to another team member to
symbolize that you are not in the facilitator role while you participate.
(Just make sure you get the marker and your roleback.)

# Activities

Start activity :
- introduce each activity (+ describe)
- give the details for each part, just in time

Two tasks during an activity :
- available to answer questions about the activity
- monitor the room (noise level, conversation, ... need more time ?)

Debrief every activity :
- Start by asking for observable events and sensory input.
  "What did you see and hear?"
- Ask how people responded to those events and inputs.
  "What surprised you? Where were you challenged?"
- Ask for insights and analysis with questions,
  like "What insight do you have about this?"
  followed by "What does this tell you about our project?"
  These questions help people formulate their ideas and connect the activity to the project.
- After you've established the link between the activity and the project,
  complete the learning cycle by asking group members how they will apply their insights:
  "What's one thing you might do differently?"

> Follow the same flow as the retrospective structure
> (gather data, both facts and feelings; generate insights; and decide what to do).

> Spend 50-100% as much time on debriefing as on the activity.
> So for a ten-minute activity, allow five to ten minutes for debriefing.

# Group Dynamics and participation

Making sure people who have something to say have the chance and
making sure people who have a lot to say don't dominate.

> "We haven't heard X and Y yet. What would you add?"
> "We've heard from you on every question; let's hear from some other people."

Coach manager on appropriate participation.
Ask them to let others talk first, acknowledge the contributions others make,
and be careful how they disagree.

Sometimes teams become stuck.
When that happens, you have options as a retrospective leader :
- You can help restore their creative juices by asking questions :
  - What have we tried before? What happened?
  - What would you like to happen differently?
  - If we had that, what would we gain?
  - Have you ever tried this a different way? What happened?

You can ask for more opinions, especially from people who
have been thinking more than talking.
You can suggest additional research before committing to a solution.
You can take off the retrospective leader hat and offer content knowledge from personal experience.
You could tell the team what to do, but only if you want to cheat their learning.

After managing participation, the next most common issues are violating working agreements and blaming.

Encourage "I" language. "I" language centers on the speaker's observation and experience,
rather than labeling the other person.
When you hear blame or personal criticism, intervene and redirect the discussion to the content.

Group dynamics include team member interactions and emotions.
You aren't responsible for other people's emotions, but as retrospective leader,
you are responsible for keeping the session productive.
And that means you need to be prepared to handle emotional interactions and situations.

Emotions to manage:
- Tears
- Shouting
- Stomping Out
- Inappropriate Laughter and Clowning
- Uncharacteristic Silence
- Currents Beneath the Surface

# Time

Dilemma :
- respond to the needs of the group
- pay attention to time and stay within the timebox

Never ending discussion :
- ask the group what they want to do
- "I'm concerned that if we continue this discussion we won't meet our end goal.
  What do you want to do?"
- the group will refocus and move ahead, or they will tell you this conversation is more important than the original goal
- put the decision in the hands of the group

Be prepared to swap to a shorter activity if time is running short.

# You

In case of problem :
- "What just happened?"
- "How much was inside me, and how much was outside me?"
- "How did the group get here?"
- "Where does the group need to go next?"
- "What are three options I have for next steps?"
- "What will I offer the group?"
