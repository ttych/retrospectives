# The 4-Steps Debriefing Method

> Debrief every activity !

- Start by asking for observable events and sensory input.
  "What did you see and hear?"
- Ask how people responded to those events and inputs.
  "What surprised you? Where were you challenged?"
- Ask for insights and analysis with questions,
  like "What insight do you have about this?"
  followed by "What does this tell you about our project?"
  These questions help people formulate their ideas and connect the activity to the project.
- After you've established the link between the activity and the project,
  complete the learning cycle by asking group members how they will apply their insights:
  "What's one thing you might do differently?"


# The 1-Question Debrief

- "What's the first thing you want to say about this activity?"


# Journal Debrief

Develop two or three questions, and give seven to ten minutes
for people to answer the questions in their journals.
When time is up, ask whether anyone has an insight he or she would share with the group.

Journal questions work for debriefing when the goal is personal reflection:
- "How would an outsider say you contribute to this situation?"
- "What's one thing you personally can do to improve this situation?"
- "What's one thing you will do differently in our next iteration?"
- "What is one change you can commit to in the next iteration?"


# Question Pairs

- What interesting things happened during this activity?
  What did you learn about yourself or your teammates?
- How was your experience in the activity like other things that have happened in the team (or during the iteration)?
  What team strengths showed up?
- How has your thinking changed after this activity?
  If you could go back and change only one thing, what would it be?


# What If

Encourage the team to think in new ways.

- What if the timeline had been ordered from present to past instead of from past to present?
- What if you had twice as much time for brainstorming?
- What if different people had been in the small groups?
- What if we started the activity over right now?
