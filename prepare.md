# Basic Structure

## History and Environment

- artifacts available vs missing
- talk to leader / team
  - What did this iteration produce? What was the team aiming for?
    How did the result meet (or not meet) expectations?
  - What's going on elsewhere in the organization that affects the team as they go into the retrospective?
	For example, are there rumors of layoffs?
    Has there been a recent merger?
	A canceled product?
  - What is the history of previous project reviews?
    What happened, and what was the follow-up?
  - What are the relationships between team members - how is their work interdependent?
	What are their personal connections and working relationships?
  - What are team members feeling? What are their concerns or anxieties?
    What are they excited about?
  - What kind of outcome will achieve value for the time invested both for the retrospective sponsor and the team?
  - How has the team worked with facilitators before?

=> choose appropriate goal

## Goal for the Retrospective

A useful goal provides a sense of why people are investing their time,
without predetermining what actions or direction the team will take
after the retrospective.

A restrictive goal acts as a blinder.

Unlike more general goals, here you want to avoid goals
that define a specific measurable outcome.

Examples:
- Find ways to improve our practices.
- Discover what we were doing well.
- Understand reasons behind missed targets.
- Find ways to improve our responsiveness to customers.
- Rebuild damaged relationships.

## Duration

Depends on :
- Length of the iteration
- Complexity (of the technology, relationships with external depart-
ments, organization of the team)
- Size of the team
- Level of conflict or controversy

> if it produces only superficial insights and shallow plans, it may need more time

## Structuring

| Step                    | Distribution | Default distribution | 1h / 60min | 1h30 / 90min | 2h / 120min |
|-------------------------|--------------|----------------------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Set the Stage           | 5%           | 5%                   | 3 minutes  | 4 minutes    | 6 minutes   |
| Gather Data             | 30-50%       | 34%                  | 21 minutes | 31 minutes   | 41 minutes  |
| Generate Insights       | 20-30%       | 22%                  | 13 minutes | 20 minutes   | 26 minutes  |
| Decide What to Do       | 15-20%       | 17%                  | 10 minutes | 15 minutes   | 20 minutes  |
| Close the Retrospective | 10%          | 10%                  | 6 minutes  | 9 minutes    | 12 minutes  |
| Shuffle time            | 10-15%       | 12%                  | 7 minutes  | 11 minutes   | 15 minutes  |

> break every 90 minutes if global time > 2 hours

## Summary

Decision: What is the goal?

> Learn from mishaps on the previous iteration, uncover root causes of those problems.

Decision: Who will attend?

> The team.

Decision: How long?

> Two-and-a-half hours. The first retrospective may take longer because
> we're unfamiliar with this style of discussion. Also, we've been working
> for twelve weeks and for these issues, we'll need to look back further
> than the our previous two-week iteration.

Decision: Where do we hold the retrospective?

> A conference room that can comfortably hold twenty people. People
> need to be able to move around for small group work.

Decision: How will we set up the room?

> Move the tables to the side of the room. Start seated in a semicircle
> facing the long wall and then move to the corners of the room for small
> group work. We don't want people seated around a conference table.
> The semicircle will allow everyone to see each other for the initial dis-
> cussion. We'll need variety and space for people to move around.

## Wrap-Up

- What is the context surrounding the retrospective?
- What is the goal for this retrospective?
- How long will the retrospective be?
- Where will we hold the retrospective?
- What's the basic structure?


# Activities

> Timeboxed processes.

> Provide structure to help thinking together and have several advantages over freewheeling discussion.

Activities do the following:
- Encourage Equal Participation (work in smaller group)
- Focus the Conversation (frame the conversation, reduce change of tangential drift)
- Encourage New Perspectives (bring people outside their day-to-day modes of thinking)

> Icebreakers, energizers, and games that don't relate to the work don't fit in retrospectives. There's only so much time, so don't waste it with activities that are "just for fun." Have fun, but have a purpose.

> ARCS : Attention, Relevance, Confidence/Competence, Satisfaction
>
> Choose activities that help people stay engaged so they don't drift off (Attention)
> and that are relevant to the goal (Relevance).
> You want activities that people can accomplish successfully (Confident/Competence).
> Avoid activities that are designed to make people feel stupid, inept, or set up.
> People usually become angry when they feel set up and become defensive if they feel they're looking or acting like dummies.
> Finally, make sure activities fit into the overall design so people think the retrospective is a good use of their time (Satisfaction).


> Choose two activities for each stage :
>  one short and one long.
> Substitute the shorter activity if time is tight.
